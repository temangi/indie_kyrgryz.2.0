Dramatic Places in Kyrgyzstan`,
  desc: `Kel-Suu, also known as Kol-Tetiri, is one of the most isolated and visually striking
destinations in Kyrgyzstan. Hidden deep in the mountains near the Chinese border, this
high-altitude lake feels untouched, raw, and almost unreal.
Steep cliffs rise directly from the water, creating a narrow, fjord-like landscape that changes
constantly with light, weather, and seasons.`,
  geography: `Kel-Suu is a high-mountain lake located at an altitude of approximately 3,500 meters above
sea level in the At-Bashy region, close to the border with China.
The lake was formed as a result of a natural landslide and is fed mainly by underground
water sources. Its water level can change significantly depending on the season and
precipitation, sometimes revealing or hiding parts of the lake.
Due to its remote location, Kel-Suu is accessible only during the warmer months, typically
from June to September, and requires special border permits.`,
